The Normalized Cycling League is designed to enrich your cycling experience by providing an enhanced view of your performance. While it may not give you a comprehensive overview of every aspect of your activity, it offers an innovative way to rank your activity based on normalized data.

Each week, you can input your ride details - distance, elevation, and time - into the tool. Our advanced algorithm then normalizes this data and places your performance in a weekly table, which gives you a unique perspective on how your rides compare to others. This method allows us to rank rides across different terrains and distances.

The goal is not just to track your progress, but to give you a deeper understanding of your performance. With this tool, you can appreciate the nuances of your rides and see how even the smallest changes can influence your ranking. It adds an element of friendly competition, allowing you to strive for improvement while enjoying your cycling journey.

### And now?

So, gear up, hit the road, and explore the world of cycling with the Normalized Cycling League tool. Log your rides, watch your ranking in the weekly table, and discover how every ride counts in its unique way. It's not about winning, it's about understanding and appreciating your individual performance. Enjoy your ride and let the Normalized Cycling League tool enhance your cycling experience.
