The **20K Normalized Cycling Challenge** is a monthly worldwide event open to all cycling enthusiasts - whether you're a road biker, mountain biker, gravel biker, or an indoor cyclist. All you need to do is submit your best 20-22km ride data. To keep the competition purely based on human effort, e-bikes are not included.

We utilize a unique scoring system, the **NCL Race Score**. This system equalizes the competition by taking into account varying riding conditions and minimizing the advantage of longer rides. Your NCL Race Score, reflecting your best ride's overall effort, determines your rank on the leaderboard. üèÜ

In addition to the NCL Race Score, all your rides contribute to your overall NCL Value. This value, rewarding longer rides, is calculated separately. So, we have two distinct scores:

* The **NCL Race Score** for the race conditions and challenges
* And the **NCL Value** for all your rides which will save you a spot in the overall league leaderboard.

An exciting addition is that any submitted activity within this 20-22km distance to the NCL League will automatically make you a participant in the 20K Normalized Cycling Challenge. It's that simple! üî•

At the end of the month, the **top three** cyclists with the highest NCL Race Scores are named the winners. But remember, every participant is celebrated for their dedication. üèÖ
