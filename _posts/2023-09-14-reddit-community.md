# Normaliced Cycling Leage Community @ Reddit
I've just created a new reddit community where I hope to receive feedback, ideas, questions and more! **[r/normalizedcycling](https://www.reddit.com/r/normalizedcycling/)**

I know that this method/tooling is not the perfect solution, but in my imaginaton it comes pretty close to what could be a community driven, online cycling league where everyone can particpate, whether it's indoor, outdoo, e-bike, biobike or whatever.

## What could be the next steps?
First of all, if you are reading this, try it out and give it chance. What could happen? You compete against my activities and most likely you will be on the podium! :-)
Next initatives could be:
* organized races at a certain time to achieve a defined distance or duration
* monthly challenges to e.g. become a mountain goat
* achievement badges for reaching certain milestones or completing specific challenges
* virtual rewards or incentives for consistently participating and improving your performance
* community events or meetups for participants to connect and ride together in person
* a point system based on activity level and performance, with the opportunity to earn rewards or prizes
* intrduce teams and team competitions where participants can join forces and compete against other teams
  
These are just a few ideas to add gamification elements and make the Normalized Cycling League even more engaging and exciting for participants. 
Remember, this is a community-driven initiative, so feel free to share your thoughts, ideas and suggestions!
