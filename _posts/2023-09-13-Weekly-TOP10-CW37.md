The Normalized Cycling League is an innovative platform designed to enrich your cycling experience. It provides an enhanced view of your performance by ranking your activity based on normalized data. The goal is not merely to track your progress but to give you a deeper understanding of your performance.

This method allows us to rank rides across different terrains and distances, offering a unique perspective on how your rides compare to others.
