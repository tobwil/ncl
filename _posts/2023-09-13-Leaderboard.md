Hello, cycling enthusiasts! Welcome to week 37 of 2023. It's time to take a look at our live leaderboard and see who's leading the pack in the Normalized Cycling League (NLC). 

## What is NLC?

The Normalized Cycling League is an innovative platform designed to enrich your cycling experience. It provides an enhanced view of your performance by ranking your activity based on normalized data. The goal is not merely to track your progress but to give you a deeper understanding of your performance.
Each week, you can input your ride details - distance, elevation, and time. Our advanced algorithm then normalizes this data and places your performance in a weekly table. This method allows us to rank rides across different terrains and distances, offering a unique perspective on how your rides compare to others.
