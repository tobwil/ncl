## FAQ: Understanding Normalized Data in Biking Activities

### What is the NCL Value?

The NCL Value is a single value that encompasses multiple indicators of biking activities, providing a comprehensive measure of overall effort. It takes into account factors such as distance, elevation gained, time, pace, and speed, assigning weights to each indicator based on their relative importance.

Calculating the NCL Value involves assigning weights to each indicator and combining them using a weighted average approach. This results in a single value that represents the overall effort of the biking activity.

The NCL Value allows for easy comparison and interpretation of biking performances, making it a useful tool for evaluating and tracking progress. It provides a standardized measure that incorporates multiple factors, giving a more complete understanding of the effort involved in biking activities.

### What is nDistance?

nDistance is a normalized measure of the overall effort required for a biking activity. It takes into account both the distance of the activity and the total elevation gained, giving more weight to the distance.

### What does nPace represent?

nPace is the average time you would take to complete a unit distance considering both the actual distance and the elevation gained. It is the ratio of the time taken to the normalized distance.

### What is nSpeed?

nSpeed is a normalized measure of the average speed during a biking activity. It takes into account both the actual distance covered and the time taken, providing a standardized speed value.

### What does nPWR indicate?

nPWR represents the normalized power output during a biking activity. It is calculated by multiplying the cycling capability (watts per kilogram) by the weight of the bike and rider. This measure provides an indication of the power output relative to the weight of the cyclist.

### What is W/kg?

W/kg stands for watts per kilogram and is a measure of the power output per unit weight of the cyclist. It is commonly used in cycling to compare the relative power output of different riders, as it takes into account the rider's weight.

### How can I interpret the nPWR value?

The nPWR value gives an indication of the power output during a biking activity, factoring in the cyclist's weight. A higher nPWR value suggests a higher power output relative to the weight, indicating a stronger performance.
